# Electric-Vehicle-Tableau
This project features an interactive electric vehicle (EV) dashboard created using Tableau. The dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize key metrics related to EVs in Washington, DC, using data sourced from a Kaggle dataset. Key performance indicators include the total number of EVs, average electric range, and the proportions of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

The dashboard includes five dynamic visualizations:

An area chart displaying total vehicles by model year.
A map showing vehicle distribution across the USA.
A bar graph of the top 10 vehicle makes.
A pie chart of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
A table of vehicles by model.
It also features four interactive filters to allow users to explore the data based on CAFV eligibility, EV type, vehicle model, and state. Users can interact with any of the visualizations to see updates reflected across the entire dashboard, providing a detailed and responsive analysis of the EV landscape.
